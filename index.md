This is a one day project aimed at understanding the basics of neural networks. 

##GAME 
In this project, I have created a very simple game using Pygame. The objective of the games is to ovoid colliding with the blocks runing across the screen by using the up and down keys. Once the games was up and working, I replaced the key controls with outputs from the neural network. The possible outputs are moving up, moving down, or staying in place.
